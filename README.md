# Worker Mode for WordPress and WooCommerce powered by Action Scheduler

Worker mode is an architectural pattern that enables web applications to handle resource-intensive tasks asynchronously and efficiently. It separates the main application thread from background processing to maintain optimal performance and user experience.

## Key Benefits of Worker Mode

- **Improved Performance:** By offloading heavy tasks to background workers, the main application remains responsive and fast
- **Better Resource Management:** Workers can distribute system resources effectively across different tasks
- **Scalability:** Easy to scale worker processes independently based on workload demands
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Users don't experience delays while complex operations run in the background

## Common Use Cases in E-commerce

- **Order Processing:** Handle payment processing, inventory updates, and order fulfillment in the background
- **Inventory Management:** Process bulk product updates and synchronization with external systems
- **Email Notifications:** Send order confirmations, shipping updates, and marketing emails asynchronously
- **Report Generation:** Create complex reports and analytics without impacting store performance
- **Image Processing:** Handle product image optimization and variant generation in the background
- **Price Updates:** Manage bulk price changes and promotional updates efficiently
